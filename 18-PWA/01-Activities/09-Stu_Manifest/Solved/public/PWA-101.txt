Create a PWA!

We have 3 main ingredients: 

1. A Manifest File - provides our devices with metadata about the application 
(icons, start url's, naming, etc.) to support the download process

2. Service Workers - help us manage and respond to requests sent from the frontend when 
we don't have a valid connection 

3. Browser Cache (Cache API) - gives us a place to store files / responses so that we can 
still access resources that our app needs without a web connection
