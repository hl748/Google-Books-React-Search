#Pseudocode Captain Planet

1. We need html (specifically cards and buttons, plus our captain planet image)
2. Link our jQuery CDN
3. We need to be sure that every button had a unique class/id
4. We need to target those classes/ids and create our click events for them
5. The handler/callback function for this click event
6. In the handler/callback function we need to modify our images/css in some way
    utilize the jQuery .animate() method to make our superpowers more appealing
